# Facebook Aperture Exporter

## About

This is a sinmple exporter plugin for Apple's Aperture. I wasn't happy with the built-in syncing Aperture 3 has, and the existing export plugin for Facebook wouldn't work for me. Plus, that author wasn't returning my emails to try and get it to work. So I wrote me own.

Currently, this plugin supports:
* logging in and out of a Facebook account
* album creation and selection (where to upload the photos to)
* high resolution uploads to Facebook

## Usage and Installation

After downloading, this plugin should be put in the directory `~/Library/Application Support/Aperture/Plug-Ins/Export`. If the `Plug-Ins` and / or `Export` directories do not exist, create them.  If Aperture is running, restart it.  Then select the versions to export, choose `File -> Export -> FacebookExporter...`
